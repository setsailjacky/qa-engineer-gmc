# Generic Message Component Challenge

## Estimated Duration: 1 Hour

We personally don't recommend going on beyond this 1 hour as we wouldn't want you to feel overwhelmed with the interview process.

# Context

We have developed a simple messaging application similar to whatsapp that allows users to talk to other users with text. However we notice that we don't have any test for this application. Seems it would be nicer to have enough tests.

# Goal

You will be given a react application that lacks tests, and your goal is to design your own tests to test through the application. You can also propose how to improve the application, so that it can provide better quality and experience.

There are 3 message types that we support, these include:

1. **Text**
2. **Image**
3. **Attachment**

You can take a look at the application [here](https://setsailjacky.github.io/qa-engineer-gmc/).

# Example Test Cases

### All Messages

- Should display on the correct side (left or right)
- Should include a readable timestamp

**You should propose your own plan on test cases!**

# Before you get started!

The codes are inside `/src` folder, please take some time to read it through.

**Also** If you're not familiar with typescript that's ok, give it your best shot!

# Running your App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
